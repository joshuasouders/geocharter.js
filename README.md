Geocharter.js
===============

A charting and mapping library created to facilitate the rapid deployment of geodashboards.

* In heavy development, not yet suitable for use.
* See example folder for a practical example.

This library has a ton of potential, in my mind. It utilizes a grid system so that you can place charts wherever you want exteremely easily. All you do is specify the data, the chart type, and the chart location within the grid and congrats, you have a dashboard. It also displays tabular data and GeoJSON on a Leaflet map. It's not the most heavily customizable library, at least not yet, but it's perfect for a basic dashboard. While the basics of this framework are already written, I haven't had a project yet where this library would be a suitable fit. I'm anxiously awaiting a project that will allow me to build this framework up in the process.

Runs off of Chart.js, Leaflet, and Bootstrap.
